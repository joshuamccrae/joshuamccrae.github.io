Hey! My name is Joshua McCrae and I am currently a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University. I am originally from New Castle, Delaware. I enjoy things such as listening to hip-hop and lo-fi music, working out, cars, and going down Youtube rabbit-holes. Welcome to my GitHub Webpage!

## Lab 1 - Artemis Setup and Connection

### Lab 1A: Setup

The purpose of this portion of the lab is to get comfortable using the Arduino IDE and Sparkfun Apollo 3 board manager. Once I downloaded the Arduino IDE and installed the correct board manager, I was able to connect my Artemis Nano to my laptop and upload some basic example sketches to it:

### Example 1: Blink

In this example, the Artemis recieves a signal from the Arduino IDE to blink it's LED repeatedly until the program is terminated. The blue blinking LED can be seen in action below.

### Example 2: Serial

In this example, we input some text into the serial monitor (in this case "hello") and the Artemis "echo's", or repeats this input back to us as seen below.

### Example 3: Temperature Sensing

Here, I am increasing the temperature of the Artemis chip by breathing on it. This temperature change is reflected in the serial monitor output as seen below.

### Example 4: Pitch Sensing

Lastly, this example tests the onboard microphone on our Artemis. I increase the frequency of the loudest sound it detects by whistling, the value output to the serial monitor increases, as seen below.
