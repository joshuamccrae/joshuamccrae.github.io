Hey! My name is Joshua McCrae and I am currently a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University. I am originally from New Castle, Delaware. I enjoy things such as listening to hip-hop and lo-fi music, working out, cars, and going down Youtube rabbit-holes. Welcome to my GitHub Webpage!

## Lab 1 - Artemis Setup and Connection

### Lab 1A: Setup

The purpose of this portion of the lab is to get comfortable using the Arduino IDE and Sparkfun Apollo 3 board manager. Once I downloaded the Arduino IDE and installed the correct board manager, I was able to connect my Artemis Nano to my laptop and some basic example sketches to it:

### Example 1: Blink
